		<h3>Answers</h3>
		<br>
		<a name="q1"></a><h5><strong>How do I make a bet?</strong></h5>
		<p>Answer to Question 1.</p>
		<a name="q2"></a><h5><strong>How do I share my bet with a friend?</strong></h5>
		<p>Answer to Question 2.</p>
		<a name="q3"></a><h5><strong>Can I change my bet once I've created it?</strong></h5>
		<p>No.  The premise of SetInStone is that bets, once placed, can never be changed.  If we allowed users the opportunity to change their bets after placing them, we would be defeating the purpose of the site.</p>
		<a name="q4"></a><h5><strong>Can I add more than one friend to my bet?</strong></h5>
		<p>No.  At the moment, users can only place bets with one other user.  Allowing for multiple users on a single bet may be a functionality that will be added in the future.</p>
		<a name="q5"></a><h5><strong>Is there a limit on the number of bets I can create?</strong></h5>
		<p>Nope!  You can create as many as you would like.</p>
		<a name="q6"></a><h5><strong>Will my bets exist forever?</strong></h5>
		<p>Bets that have been "closed" (i.e. both members of the bet have submitted their portions of the bet) will exist forever.  Bets that are left "open" (i.e. one member of the bet has not yet submitted his portion) will only exist for ten days, after which they will be deleted.</p>
		<a name="q7"></a><h5><strong>Can I see all of the bets I've ever created?</strong></h5>
		<p>Answer to Question 7.</p>
		<a name="q8"></a><h5><strong>Can anyone create an account on SetInStone?</strong></h5>
		<p>Yes!  This site is open to everyone.</p>
		<a name="q9"></a><h5><strong>Can I delete my bet after creating it?</strong></h5>
		<p>If your bet has not yet been accepted, you will have the option to delete it.  Bets that have been accepted by the second party will be set in stone and cannot be deleted.</p>
